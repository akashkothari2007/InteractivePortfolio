Personal Website Interactive
============================

This project is an interactive personal website that combines a **Unity 3D** scene with a **React** front end.

- **Unity 3D WebGL**: The core 3D experience was built in Unity and exported as a WebGL build.
- **Embedded in React**: The WebGL build is embedded inside a React application so it can live alongside standard web content.
- **Overlays & UI**: React components provide overlays, panels, and UI elements on top of the Unity canvas.
- **Animations & Transitions**: React is also used for page transitions, animations, and other interactive effects layered over the 3D scene.

To explore or modify the 3D room, open the Unity project that produced the WebGL build. To change the website layout, overlays, or animations, edit the React source in the `portfolio/src` folder.
